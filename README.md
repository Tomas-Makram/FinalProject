# 🌱 Eco Recyclers GreenTech

## 📋 Project Description

Eco Recyclers GreenTech is a comprehensive, C#-based graduation project designed to simulate a real-world commercial ecosystem that manages, tracks, and organizes all types of data related to products and users. The system provides an integrated digital environment that enables merchants, factories, companies, craftsmen, and workers to efficiently manage their products and services through an interactive platform that supports displaying, selling, sharing, exchanging, or renting items.

The platform aims to bridge the gap between suppliers and customers by offering a unified system where merchants and organizations can register, manage their accounts, and showcase their products. Craftsmen and workers can promote their skills and services, apply for jobs, and reach potential clients. Users can easily browse available products, compare prices, request services, or rent items for short-term use.

The system ensures transparency, accessibility, and sustainability in product usage, encouraging recycling, reusing, and resource optimization. Eco Recyclers GreenTech targets both commercial and environmental goals: reducing waste, maximizing product lifetime, and promoting responsible consumption within a modern digital marketplace.
